# Concept Notes: W-V-La-TiC Fusion Materials

## Origin

Proposed via simulated materials testing as superior to:
- Pure W (brittle, recrystallizes)
- W-La2O3 (no ductility enhancement)
- EUROFER97 (low temp limit, high swelling)

## Rationale

Vanadium:
- Solid solution softening → lowers DBTT
- Low activation → decays to stable Ti
- Suppresses void swelling under irradiation

La (as La2O3):
- Oxide dispersion → pins dislocations and He bubbles
- Getter for impurities

TiC:
- Surface hardening → reduces sputtering
- Stabilizes grain boundaries → delays recrystallization

## Future Work

- Thermodynamic modeling (W-V-Ti-C-La system)
- Neutronic activation simulations
- Fabrication trials (MA + HIP)
- Ion beam testing (He/D damage)
- Functionally graded prototypes
