# 🌋 W-V-La-TiC Fusion Wall Materials Research

> *Open research initiative for next-gen plasma-facing and structural fusion materials:  
> **W-6.98V-0.02La-0.1TiC** (structural) & **W-94.9V-0.02La-0.1TiC** (plasma-facing)*

Simulated and proposed as superior alternatives to current ITER/DEMO baseline materials (pure W, EUROFER97) for nuclear fusion reactors.

✅ Higher radiation resistance  
✅ Lower activation  
✅ Improved ductility (high-V variant)  
✅ Better thermal conductivity (high-W variant)  
✅ Novel oxide/carbide dispersion strengthening

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters

No existing fusion material satisfies all DEMO requirements. These compositions:
- Use **low-activation vanadium** instead of Re, Ta, or Mo
- Integrate **La₂O₃ + TiC** for microstructural stability
- Are **functionally gradable** (W-rich surface → V-rich subsurface)
- Are fabricable via **powder metallurgy + HIP**
